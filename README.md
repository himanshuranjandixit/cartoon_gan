# cartoon_gan
A PyTorch implementation of a GAN model that transforms real images into cartoon-style visuals. Based on deep convolutional architectures, the generator learns to stylize photos while preserving structure, using adversarial training with a discriminator. Ideal for anime/cartoonization tasks and creative image filters
